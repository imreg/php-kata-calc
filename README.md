# PHP-Kata-Calc

A very simple solution to show how PhpSpec and PhpUnit must be used in test

Feel free to use this code


### Deployment

```
> composer install
```

### To run test:

```
> composer run test
```

```
> composer run test-spec  OR  bin/phpspec run
```

```
> composer run test-unit  OR  bin/phpunit
```
